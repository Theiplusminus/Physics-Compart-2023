35. When a ray of light passes from a denser to a rarer medium, it bends away from the normal. If we go on increasing the angle of incidence in denser medium, then for a particular value of angle of incidence, the incident ray is refracted along the interface of the two media. This angle is called critical angle (ic). If incident angle (i) is greater than critical angle (ic), then the ray of light is reflected back in the same denser medium. This phenomenon is called total internal reflection of light.
